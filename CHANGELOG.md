# Changelog

All notable changes to kardashev are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Versioning

kardashev uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). It is **pre-1.0**, so
each completed **roadmap** is a `MINOR` bump (Roadmap v9 → `0.9.0`, v10 →
`0.10.0`) and bug-fix releases bump `PATCH`. Per SemVer's 0.x rule anything may
change between minors until 1.0. `1.0.0` is reserved for a language-surface
**stability commitment**; after it the language evolves via opt-in **editions**
(the Rust model) rather than `MAJOR` bumps. The version lives in
`compiler/include/kardashev/version.hpp` (reported by `kardc --version`),
`MODULE.bazel`, and here.

`0.9.0` is the first tagged release; the entries below `0.9.0` document the
pre-tag roadmap history (Phases 0–56), each of which shipped fully green (6 unit
suites + the smoke aggregate, JIT **and** AOT).

## [Unreleased] — Roadmap v10 (Phases 57–62, in progress)

Theme: **sized and sound at compile time** — const-generic type params + the
effect system's last soundness floor.

### Added
- Const-generic parameters parse and bind: `const N: i64` (mixed with type
  params), a symbolic `[i64; N]` array length, and the `let (a, b): (T, T) = ..`
  tuple-pattern annotation (Phase 57 — declaration shell only).
- Monomorphization over a const VALUE (Phase 58): `Mat<3>` and `Mat<5>` become
  DISTINCT LLVM struct types (`{ [3 x i64] }` vs `{ [5 x i64] }`, mangled
  `Mat__c3` / `Mat__c5`), incl. nested `Matrix<R, C>` over `[[i64; C]; R]`. The
  const value substitutes the symbolic array length; a struct literal infers
  each `const N` from the dimensions of the field that carries it
  (`Mat { data: [1,2,3] }` is a `Mat<3>`). Type/const argument slot mismatches,
  a const-value dimension mismatch, and negative const args are compile errors.
- Const-generic FUNCTIONS + compile-time dimension unification (Phase 59):
  `fn dot<const N>(a: [i64; N], b: [i64; N]) -> i64` infers N from the argument
  array lengths, lets `N` be used as a value in the body, and monomorphizes per
  size (`@dot__c3` over `[3 x i64]` vs `@dot__c2`). A dimension MISMATCH
  (`dot([i64;3], [i64;2])`) and a const param that appears in no argument array
  type are compile errors.

- `RingBuffer<T, const CAP>` (Phase 61): a struct generic over BOTH a type and
  a const param, with element-wise Drop and deep clone over a NON-Copy element.
  Fixed-size arrays `[T; N]` now allow non-Copy elements (String/struct/Vec/Box)
  — clone element-wise, drop element-wise; moving a non-Copy element out by
  index (`let x = a[i]`) is a compile error (clone or borrow instead). Symbolic
  const params flow through generic impls (`impl<T, const CAP> Clone for
  RingBuffer<T, CAP>`) and `derive(Clone)`. Plus closure-param INFERENCE:
  `vec_map(v, |x| *x * 2)` infers `x`'s type from the callee's fn-typed
  parameter — no `|x: &i64|` annotation needed.

### Changed
- The **effect-subset rule** (Phase 60), the effect system's last soundness
  floor: a trait impl method's effects must be a SUBSET of the trait method's
  declared effects, so a `dyn Trait` / `<T: Trait>` dispatch (which attributes
  the TRAIT's effects) can never under-count what an impl actually does. A
  super-effecting impl is a compile error. `Drop` is exempt (static drop glue,
  never dyn-dispatched). To make the prelude honest, `Eq::eq`,
  `Iterator::next`, `Display::to_string` and `Default::default` now declare
  `! { alloc }` (their container/heap impls allocate); a concrete `for` loop
  still attributes its concrete `next`'s effects, so pure (Range) loops stay
  pure, and `derive(Eq)` annotates `! { alloc }` only when a field's `eq`
  actually allocates (a map-/Vec-/generic-free struct's derived `eq` is pure).

## [0.9.0] — Roadmap v9 "data in motion" (Phases 51–56)

### Added
- `Box<T>` as a first-class impl target + `&*`/`**` deref ergonomics, and
  prelude `Clone`/`Eq` for `Box<T>`.
- Generic associated functions: a bounded `T::method()` (e.g. `T::default()`).
- `Vec` higher-order combinators `vec_map` / `vec_filter` / `vec_fold` over
  closures (effect-polymorphic).
- String tokenizing (`str_split`, `str_trim`) and `hashmap_entries → Vec<(K,V)>`.
- Capstone `examples/wordfreq` — a word-frequency histogram pipeline.

### Fixed
- A pre-merge adversarial review hardened 5 memory-safety / type-soundness
  holes the green smoke suite had missed (by-value container-getter double-free,
  `dyn Trait<T>` argument confusion, move-out-of-`&` via `*r`, `&mut` reborrow
  aliasing, an unjoined `if`-branch move-state) plus dyn/generic effect
  attribution — locked in by `tests/smoke_test_soundness.sh`.

## [0.8.0] — Roadmap v8 "generics, finished" (Phases 45–50)

### Added
- Bounded type params (`K: Hash + Eq`) inside container ops; prelude `Clone`/`Eq`
  trait impls for `HashMap`.
- `Ord` trait + a generic in-place `sort<T: Ord>` (+ `vec_swap`, `&mut → &`
  reborrow).
- `#[derive(Hash, Ord, Default)]` and associated functions (static
  `Type::method()`).
- `dyn Trait<T>` generic trait objects + dispatch through `Vec<Box<dyn …>>`.
- Capstone `examples/json` upgraded to JSON 3.0 — `HashMap<String, Json>`
  objects, fully `#[derive]`d, canonical sorted-key output.

## [0.7.0] — Roadmap v7 "real numbers, real abstraction" (Phases 39–44)

### Added
- `f64` floating point.
- Generic `impl<T: Bound>` blocks; generic `Clone`/`Eq` over containers;
  `#[derive(Clone, Eq, Display)]`.
- Runtime string escapes; the last async-frame leak closed.
- Capstone JSON 2.0 — floats + decoded escapes + derived `Clone`/`Eq`.

## [0.6.0] — Roadmap v6 "make the heap recursive" (Phases 33–38)

### Added
- Sound recursive heap-owning enums (`Box`/`Vec<Self>`/`HashMap<K,Self>`) with
  recursive `Drop` + deep `clone`; read-without-move + `match`-by-reference;
  enum-typed struct fields + non-Copy tuples; `Display` + de-`i64`'d iteration.
- Capstone: a full nested-JSON parser + serializer written in kardashev.

### Fixed
- An `-O1+` miscompile: the optimizer ran without the target datalayout, folding
  multi-field-aggregate reads-through-a-pointer to wrong byte offsets.

## [0.5.0] — Roadmap v5 (Phases 27–32)

### Added
- Stdlib depth (string toolkit, generic `HashMap<K,V>`), file I/O + CLI args,
  `Drop`-leak fixes, and self-written capstones (`examples/calc`,
  `examples/rpn`). Docs + a source-comment truth pass.

## [0.4.0] — Roadmap v4 (Phases 21–26)

### Added
- Generic trait parameters + associated types + `where` clauses; fixed-size
  arrays `[T; N]` + tuples `(A, B)`; compile-time `const` items + const
  evaluation (incl. const-generic array lengths); `extern "C"` FFI; an
  arithmetic-interpreter capstone written in kardashev.

## [0.3.0] — Roadmap v3 (Phases 15–20)

### Added
- Expression & item completeness (bool/unary ops, inherent impls); deterministic
  memory management — `Drop`/RAII with runtime drop flags; real panic + unwinding
  with cleanup; OS threads + `Mutex`; opt-level flags + the `kardc --test` runner.

## [0.2.0] — Roadmap v2 (Phases 9–14)

### Added
- Iteration (loops, ranges, `for`); closures + effect-carrying function types
  (first-class fn values, `FnMut` captures); `dyn Trait` dynamic dispatch; a
  growable stdlib (`String`, `HashMap`, `&[T]` slices, `map`/`filter`/`fold`
  combinators, `Option`/`Result` combinators); the source formatter (`kardfmt`)
  and richer LSP.

## [0.1.0] — Roadmap v1 (Phases 0–8)

### Added
- The MVP and foundation: the full pipeline (lexer → parser → Hindley-Milner
  type inference → LLVM IR → ORC JIT + AOT); ownership + non-lexical-lifetime
  borrow checking; ADTs + pattern matching; traits + generics + monomorphization;
  `Result` + the `?` operator; **effect labels** in signatures (the signature
  feature) with effect-row polymorphism; a minimal stdlib (`Option`/`Result`/
  `Vec`/`String`) + AOT pipeline; `async`/`await` + a single-thread executor;
  the module system + `kard` CLI + `rules_kardashev` Bazel rules; `-O0..-O3`
  pass pipelines + the `kard-lsp` language server.
